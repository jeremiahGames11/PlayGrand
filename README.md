How to Play Blackjack 21:  
Objective: The goal is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value closer to 21 without going over. 
Card Values:
* Number cards (2–10) are worth their face value.
* Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points.
* Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what benefits your hand.

Gameplay:
* Both you and the dealer receive two cards. One of the dealer's cards remains hidden until the end.
* You can "Hit" to take another card or "Stand" to stick with your current hand.
* If your total exceeds 21, it’s a "bust," and you lose the round.
* The dealer must draw cards until their total is at least 17.
